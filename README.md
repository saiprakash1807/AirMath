# Overview
AirMath is a touchless, AI-powered calculator that leverages OpenCV and Mediapipe for real-time hand tracking. Users interact with the calculator by pinching their index finger and thumb to select virtual buttons, performing basic arithmetic operations. This project provides an intuitive and accessible alternative to traditional calculators, enhancing human-computer interaction through gesture-based control.

# Features
✅ Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe Hands
✅ Gesture-based input for selecting virtual buttons
✅ Basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
✅ Interactive and touch-free user experience
✅ OpenCV-based GUI for displaying numbers and results
✅ Works with a standard webcam (no special hardware required)

# Tech Stack
-Python
-OpenCV (for computer vision and real-time video processing)
-Mediapipe (for hand tracking and gesture recognition)
-NumPy (for numerical computations)

# Installations
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirMath.git
cd AirMath
```
2. Install dependencies
```
