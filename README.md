## Overview  
AirMath is a touchless, AI-powered calculator that leverages **OpenCV** and **Mediapipe** for real-time hand tracking.  
Users interact with the calculator by **pinching their index finger and thumb** to select virtual buttons, performing basic arithmetic operations.  
This project provides an intuitive and accessible alternative to traditional calculators, enhancing **human-computer interaction** through gesture-based control.  

## Features  
✅ Real-time hand tracking using **Mediapipe Hands**  
✅ Gesture-based input for selecting virtual buttons  
✅ Basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)  
✅ Interactive and touch-free user experience  
✅ OpenCV-based GUI for displaying numbers and results  
✅ Works with a standard webcam (no special hardware required)  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** (for computer vision and real-time video processing)  
- **Mediapipe** (for hand tracking and gesture recognition)  
- **NumPy** (for numerical computations)  

## Installation  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirMath.git
   cd AirMath
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
  ```sh
  pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
  ```
3. **Run application**
   ```sh
   python airmath.py
   ```
## Instructions
### Ensure your webcam is enabled ###
### Hold your hand up in front of the camera ###
### Pinch your index finger and thumb to select virtual buttons ###
### Perform calculations by selecting numbers and arithmetic operators ###
### View results on the screen in real-time ###
